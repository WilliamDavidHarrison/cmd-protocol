# üåê cmd:// Protocol
A simple `cmd://` protocol which runs commands in your terminal through your browser.

### Command Executor
The source code to `Command Executor.exe` is available in the GitHub repository, [`cmd-protocol/command-executor`](https://github.com/cmd-protocol/command-executor).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
Websites may use this protocol maliciously, so if you ever get a pop-up for it when you didn't run it voluntarily, click `Cancel` so the command doesn't run.

But don't worry if you click open, the executable will still ask for a confirmation before running the command.

## üñ±Ô∏è Setting Up

1. Download the [executable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WilliamDavidHarrison/cmd-protocol/main/Command%20Executor.exe) and [register](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WilliamDavidHarrison/cmd-protocol/main/register.reg) files.
2. Open and run the `register.reg` file.
3. Move the `Command Executor.exe` file to a new folder in `C:\Protocols\cmd`.
    - The file path of the executable should be `C:\Protocols\cmd\Command Executor.exe`.
4. Try it out!
    - In your browser, in the URL bar, type something like `cmd://help` and run the protocol.
